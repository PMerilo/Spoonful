# Spoonful

!Instructions for repo!

Only add/edit files that are in your folder. This is to prevent any merge conflicts that might occur.

If you need to add a file outside of your folder, create a new folder with your name.
If you need to edit an existing file, consult me directly so i can give you the green light or so i can do it for you.
You may change the names of your folders particularly in the pages as your route names are going to be eg. Spoonful.com/Perry/login

Try to commit as much as possible so that any errors can be undone easily.
Let me know when you push into the repo so i can clear any errors.


# IMPORTANT Please read

Ensure that you are always in your own branch with your name. (ie. Aaron, Revanth Benjamin etc) There is no reason for you to change it.
